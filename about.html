    <h1 class="page-title">About me</h1>
   <p> My name is Dilan Morales Caro and I am a Computer Science major. There are many reason surrounding my choice for this particular major which include my background, financial situation and interests.
   </p>
   <p>
I was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia where I went to a private school in which I would learn a bit of information systems, how to use a computer, how to use basic programs such as The Microsoft Office, and google blogs and even how to write extremely basic code in HTML.
<p>
Thanks to this school I developed an interest towards computers and how every one of us has the chance to modify it and create whatever we want and are able to create. Although I was beckoned by computers, my school also provided me with an interest in mathematics and numbers.
</p><p>
When I came to The United States in fall of 2016, I continued my high school and started to learn English. In the process, I became interested in Business Management. Thus, I applied to Baruch College.
</p><p>
Event though I was accepted to Baruch College as a Mathematics major, I transferred to La Guardia Community College because of my financial situation which requires me to work to attend college as a Computer science major since I thought it could be more helpful to find a job easily.
